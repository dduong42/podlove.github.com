Every player interaction is reflected in the [redux store](http://redux.js.org/docs/api/Store.html).
Accessing the players store enables the full control of the player while running.
Reacting to player events can be done by attatching to the latest action.


#### Getting store access

The store is provided after the player was initialized as a promise resolved. A redux store has two methods available: `subscribe()`, to subscribe to store changes, `getState()` to get the current state obejct and `dispatch({ type: 'action', payload: 'data' })` to dispatch a state change. The following example will set the playtime to one minute after the player was initialized.

```html
<script>
  podlovePlayer('#example', '/path/to/episode/definition/or/object', '/path/to/configuration/or/object').then(store => {
    store.dispatch({
      type: 'PLAYER_REQUEST_PLAYTIME',
      payload: 60000
    });
  })
</script>
```

### Development

To improve the development experience it is highly recommended to use the [redux devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) browser extension to get a better understandig about action dispatches and state changes.

#### Store Actions

The player provides [dozens of actions](https://github.com/podlove/podlove-ui/blob/development/packages/player/actions/types.js) to interact with the store. To simplify the implementation a [dedicated actions package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@podlove/player-actions) can be used:

```bash
$ npm install @podlove/player-actions
```

Once you've added this dependency you should be able to use it likewise:

```javascript
import { requestPlaytime } from '@podlove/player-actions/timepiece'

podlovePlayer('#example', '/path/to/episode/definition/or/object', '/path/to/configuration/or/object').then(store => {
  store.dispatch(requestPlaytime(60000));
})
```

#### Reacting to player events

Some use cases require a reaction to a player event. This is also possible by subscribing to the store:

```javascript
import { BACKEND_PLAY } from '@podlove/player-actions/types'

podlovePlayer('#example', '/path/to/episode/definition/or/object', '/path/to/configuration/or/object').then(store => {
  store.subscribe(() => {
    const { lastAction } = store.getState();

    if (lastAction.type === BACKEND_PLAY) {
      // Do something once the the player starts playing
    }
  })
})
```

### Caveats

Some actions will trigger browser APIs and are limited due to device and interaction constraints. 

#### `REQUEST_PLAY`

Audio playback is only allowed after a user interaction happened to prohibit background audio playback. Therefore the play action will only work after a user interaction.

#### `SET_VOLUME`

The volume API is only available on desktop devices. Mobile devices control the volume on a global level and doesn't react to volume changes.
